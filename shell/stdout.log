[％N2020-05-23 14:08:26.3N] Hello from Docker!
[％N2020-05-23 14:08:26.3N] This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
[％N2020-05-23 14:08:26.3N] 
[％N2020-05-23 14:08:26.3N] To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
[％N2020-05-23 14:08:26.3N] 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
[％N2020-05-23 14:08:26.3N] 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
[％N2020-05-23 14:08:26.3N] (amd64)
[％N2020-05-23 14:08:26.3N] 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
[％N2020-05-23 14:08:26.3N] executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
[％N2020-05-23 14:08:26.3N] 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
[％N2020-05-23 14:08:26.3N] to your terminal.
[％N2020-05-23 14:08:26.3N] 
[％N2020-05-23 14:08:26.3N] To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
[％N2020-05-23 14:08:26.3N] $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
[％N2020-05-23 14:08:26.3N]
